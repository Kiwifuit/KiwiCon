# Did you notice?

Yeah, I'm ditching the whole "this repo diary" thing, and instead replacing it with this

# KiwiCon
A Terminal Based program that originally was written in batch, until I realized what a horrible choice that was.

# Changes
Changes include:

- Major code changes (because I got my hands on Python 3.10, wasn't that hard lol)
    - Program does not rely on the `cmd` module unlike before
    - Moved Empathy Banana reference to the list instead of the program choosing a random number and then chooses a random splash based on the random number, which is stupid
    - Program now relies on Python 3.10 instead of 3.9.5 (This is for people who will build the executable themselves)
    - Made the banner slowly show up, as if the terminal is having a slow boot or somthing like that lmao
- Major README Changes (as you can see with the first header)
    - Removed the whole "diary" thing for a more direct README, since people might want to see the important stuff first before my rambling, A.K.A. The Diary thing.
- Moved the main script to a folder

# Notes
- I don't know how to remove that '.vscode' folder from the repository without deleting the folder itself (which will make my vscode probably revert back to 3.9.5)
